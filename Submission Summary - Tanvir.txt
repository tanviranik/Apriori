This code runs Apriori Algorithm by taking "dataT10K500D12L.data.txt" file as input. The executable has been compiled on Macbook Pro M1.

Syntax to compile the code on MacBook Pro:
g++ -O2 -std=c++11 -o apriori_tanvir apriori_tanvir.cpp

Syntax to execute the code:
./apriori_tanvir dataT10K500D12L.data.txt 0.001 0.8 a
or
./apriori_tanvir dataT10K500D12L.data.txt 0.001 0.8 r
or
./apriori_tanvir dataT10K500D12L.data.txt 0.001 0.8 a

**** The code takes 15 seconds to produce the output using g++ compiler with O2 optimizer on a MacBook Pro.

** Please have a look at the file "output.txt" which contains all the 162069 rules for this dataset. I have taken help from StackOverflow, Github for writing couple of functions. I took help from [1] to write the subset function which I found efficient and saved my time. I took help from [2] to only print the association rules.
